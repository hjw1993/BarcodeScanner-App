# BarcodeScanner-App
This App is a Native App based on React-Native and Redux, You can simply clone the project and unzip it.


Do `npm install` in the unziped folder to install all packages in package.json 
and then do `react-native run-ios` to build and run the project on IOS simulator.
I have run build the project on IOS Device(Iphone 6s), it works perfectly well. 


To run the project in Android Simulator,
just run `react-native run-android` in the commond line, but make sure a AVD is launched before, 
for this app I use Android6 API level23.
